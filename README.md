The goal of the {seam} application is to implement SEAM methodology as an interactive application in `R`.

## App

To use the Shiny application, first run the `setup.R` script. This script will take some time to run as it will download a large amount of data if you have not done so previously. This script only needs to be run once, unless there are significant changes to the data.

If `setup.R` has been run successfully, simply open `app.R` and the click the “Run App” button.

## TODO

- In general, consider quantiles of various “characteristics”
