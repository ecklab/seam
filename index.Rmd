> The SEAM (**s**ynthetic **e**stimated **a**verage **m**atchup) application allows users to visualize synthetic spray chart distributions (batted-ball distributions) for any MLB batter-pitcher matchup that has occurred or *could have occurred*^[As of SEAM 2.0, in addition to *possible* matchups that have not occurred, **impossible** matchups such as Shohei Ohtani (pitcher) versus Shohei Ohtani (batter) are estimable.] in the last four years.
